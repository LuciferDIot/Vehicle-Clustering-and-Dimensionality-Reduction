  <h1>Vehicle Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction</h1>
  <h2>1st Subtask Objectives:</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>a. Pre-processing:</strong> Before conducting k-means, perform scaling and outliers detection/removal. The order of scaling and outlier removal is important. Outlier removal is not covered in tutorials, so you need to explore it yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>b. Determining the number of cluster centers:</strong> Use four automated tools (NBclust, Elbow, Gap statistics, and silhouette methods) to determine the optimal number of clusters. Provide the related R-outputs and your discussion on these outcomes in the report.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>c. K-means clustering investigation:</strong> Perform k-means analysis using all input variables and the most favored "k" value from the automated tools. Show the related R-based kmeans output, including information for the centers, clustered results, and the ratio of Between-Cluster Sums of Squares (BSS) over Total Sum of Squares (TSS). Calculate and illustrate the BSS and Within-Cluster Sums of Squares (WSS) indices as internal evaluation metrics.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>d. Silhouette plot:</strong> Provide the silhouette plot, which displays the closeness of each point in one cluster to points in neighboring clusters. Include the average silhouette width score and your discussion on the quality of the obtained clusters.
  </p>
  <h2>2nd Subtask Objectives:</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>e. PCA method:</strong> Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the vehicle dataset and show all R-outputs related to the analysis, including eigenvalues/eigenvectors and the cumulative score per principal component (PC). Create a new "transformed" dataset with principal components as attributes, choosing PCs that provide at least a cumulative score > 92%. Provide a brief discussion for your choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>f. Determining the number of clusters for the PCA-based dataset:</strong> Apply the four automated tools to the new PCA-based dataset. Provide the related R-outputs and your discussion on the outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>g. K-means clustering on the PCA-based dataset:</strong> Perform k-means analysis using the most favored k from the automated tools. Show the related R-based kmeans output, including information for the centers, clustered results, and the ratio of BSS over TSS. Calculate and illustrate the BSS and WSS indices as internal evaluation metrics.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>h. Silhouette plot on the PCA-based dataset:</strong> Provide the silhouette plot for evaluating the quality of the obtained clusters. Include the average silhouette width score and your discussion on the plot.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>i. Calinski-Harabasz Index:</strong> Implement and illustrate the Calinski-Harabasz Index as another internal evaluation metric. Provide a brief discussion on the outcome of this index.
